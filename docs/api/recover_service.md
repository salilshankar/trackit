description: Triggers a background recovery process for the device history service by launching device_history_service.py and returns an immediate status message.

Overview
This endpoint attempts to recover (start or restart) the device history service by spawning a new background Python process that runs device_history_service.py. The response is returned immediately and does not wait for the launched process to complete.

Behavior and notes
- The server uses subprocess.Popen to launch the script in the background and does not wait for it to finish.
- The script path is resolved relative to the current file: ../../device_history_service.py.
- The command used is python <script_path>; it relies on the systemâ€™s default python executable being available on PATH.
- This endpoint performs a side-effecting operation. Ensure appropriate authentication/authorization in production.
