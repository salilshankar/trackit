title: POST /api/recover
description: Triggers a background recovery of the device history service by launching a Python script and returns a JSON status message.

Overview
This endpoint attempts to recover a backend service by starting the device_history_service.py script in a new background process. The call responds immediately; it does not wait for the script to complete or verify its runtime health.

- Implementation: subprocess.Popen(['python', <computed script path>])
- Behavior: Fire-and-forget; asynchronous process launch

Notes
- The script path is computed relative to the current module location: ../../device_history_service.py.

- No PID or process state is returned; the endpoint does not track the launched process.
