title: GET /api/device-history/{email}
description: Retrieve device history for a user by email. Proxies to an internal device-history service and returns its JSON response.

Overview
This endpoint returns the device history associated with a given user email. The route acts as a thin proxy: it opens a TCP connection to an internal device-history service running on localhost:9002, sends the email address, receives a JSON response, and returns that JSON to the client. If the internal service is unavailable or returns invalid JSON, a 500 error is returned.
