# NotificationBanner Component

The `NotificationBanner` component is designed to display important notifications to users, with an option to recover from certain actions. It is styled to catch attention with a red background and text, making it suitable for alerts or error messages.

## How to Use

1. **Display a Notification:**
   - Use the `text` prop to set the message you want to display in the notification banner. This text will be prominently shown to the user.

2. **Add a Recovery Action:**
   - Implement the `onRecover` prop to provide a callback function that will be executed when the user clicks the recovery button. This is useful for offering users a way to rectify an issue or undo an action.

### Example

```jsx
<NotificationBanner 
  text="Your session has expired. Please log in again." 
  onRecover={handleSessionRecovery} 
/>
```

### Component Structure

- **Notification Message:**
  - The main message is displayed within a `span` inside a styled `div`. The styling includes a red background and text, padding, and rounded corners for a polished look.

- **Recovery Button:**
  - A button is provided for users to trigger the recovery action. It is styled with an underline and smaller text to distinguish it from the main message.

> üìò **Note:** Ensure that the `onRecover` function is defined in your component logic to handle the recovery process effectively.

### Styling

The component uses a combination of utility classes to achieve its appearance:

- **Container (`div`):** 
  - `bg-red-100`: Light red background.
  - `text-red-800`: Dark red text for high contrast.
  - `p-2`: Padding for spacing.
  - `rounded`: Rounded corners.
  - `mb-2`: Margin at the bottom for spacing between elements.
  - `text-sm`: Smaller text size.
  - `flex justify-between items-center`: Flexbox layout for aligning items.

- **Button:**
  - `text-red-600`: Medium red text.
  - `underline`: Underlined text.
  - `text-xs`: Extra small text size.

This component does not have any mapped API routes, as it primarily focuses on displaying messages and handling user actions through the provided `onRecover` callback.
