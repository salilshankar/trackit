Query Parameters
- status (string, optional)

    - If omitted, returns all assets regardless of status.
  - Note: This value is case-sensitive (must match exactly Issued or Returned).

- sort (string, optional)
  - Allowed values: asc | desc
  - Default: desc
  - Case-insensitive.
  - Sorts by last_updated, where last_updated = COALESCE(returned_at, issued_at).
  - Any value other than asc is treated as descending.
