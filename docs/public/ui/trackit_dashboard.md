# AssetTable Component

The `AssetTable` component is designed to display a list of assets in a clean, organized table format. This component provides a straightforward way to view asset information with a user-friendly interface.

## How to Use the AssetTable

1. **Display the Table**: The `AssetTable` automatically renders a table with a white background, padding, and a shadow for a polished look. The table includes a header and rows for asset data.

2. **Table Structure**:
   - The table header (`<thead>`) is styled with a light gray background to distinguish it from the data rows.
   - Each column header (`<th>`) is left-aligned with padding for readability.
   - Asset data is displayed in rows (`<tr>`) with a border-top to separate each entry.

3. **Interacting with Data**:
   - Each row of data is clickable, allowing for potential interaction or selection.
   - The component does not explicitly provide buttons or controls for refreshing data, but it does support a `refresh` prop for potential data updates.

## Tips

- Ensure that the asset data is correctly formatted and available to be displayed in the table.
- The component is styled to be responsive and should fit within most standard layouts.

> üìò **Note**: The `AssetTable` fetches asset data using a `GET` request to the `/api/assets` endpoint. Ensure your API is configured to handle this request and return data in the expected format.

By following these instructions, you can effectively utilize the `AssetTable` component to present asset data in a structured and visually appealing manner.
